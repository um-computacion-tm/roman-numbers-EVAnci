There are two files, main.py and test_main.py, the "main" file contains
the function to conver a Decimal Number to a Roman Number.
Then the other file, test_main, contains some testing to prove that the 
function works correctly.

The "main" file won't work as a single file cause its just a function. If
you want to execute it just uncomment last line. Also if you want some
vervose to understand how it works, uncoment the print() lines.

For now, it don't work with numbers bigger than 3999. It throws numbers
that don't exist
