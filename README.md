# Roman Numbers Converter

There are two functions, roman to decimal and decimal to roman. Each function converts one number to the other (specified by the name: one system to the other system)

## Instalation

There is no need to install, just download and use it in other programs. 
Also if you want to test you can run the test_(name of the file).py (each function has a individual test).

For running any test, you can follow the example:

```bash
python3 ./example/directory/test_example.py
```

To download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/um-computacion-tm/roman-numbers-EVAnci
```

## How it works

The **decimal_to_roman(number)** function recives a integer number and returns the equivalent number in the roman numeration system.

The **roman_to_decimal(roman)** function recives a string and it's converted to uppercase in case it isn't, and returns the equivalent in decimal numeration system.

## Usage

Just import the function you need to your python program, or copy it into your program.

To import copy the following:

```python
from 
```

## Known Issues

For now, it don't work with numbers bigger than 3999, due to an ASCII limitation. Any ideas to replace the upper bar for representing the thousand (example: Five Thousand) is accepted.
